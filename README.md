# README
This project allows for take-and-leave actions with the Phantom X pincher robot, using Matlab and ROS

ROS is started, the motorsetup function is started with the desired speed of each motor, the desired end positions are written for each motor in each process position. The position is sent to each engine and waited for it to stop moving
